            I'm Thomas, a software engineer living in Boston, MA. 
            I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at Stax Payments 
            focused on revamping what their payment experience looks like 
            on mobile.

            I like making things that are pleasant to use, integrate with,
            or experience. Whether it's a contributing to a new way of
            making mobile apps with web tools, writing music, or making games;
            I like to build it all!
