[Ionic](https://ionic.io) is an open source company that builds popular, MIT-licensed projects for developers. Ionic maintains [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com), [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com), and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) - A set of UI components, a UI components builder, and a mobile runtime respectively.

At Ionic, I worked as a software engineer on Capacitor and built out the iOS and Android runtimes for developers to build their apps with. Later in my tenure at Ionic, I worked as a Developer Relations Engineer and [spoke on podcasts](https://webrush.io/episodes/episode-190-building-apps-with-capacitor-react-native-or-flutter-with-thomas-vidas), gave conference talks (sorry! no recordings!), and [wrote blog posts](https://ionic.io/blog/capacitor-community-plugins-showcase) about all things Ionic.
